# TrialRun
Console program to spin up/down VMs and Databases, locally.

Idea from wanting this, built for The Great .Net 8 Hack for #HackTogether.

Uses network share to grab custom configurations for each client (which holds Database locations, VM export location) to spin up a VM and databases, and spin them down, on your local machine.

Requires:
- PowerShell
- Hyper-V
- SQL Server
- .Net 8 (Obviously)
